(ns cases.core.d.defrecord)

;; (defrecord name [fields*] options* specs*)
;;
;; Options are expressed as sequential keywords and arguments (in any order) .
;;
;; Supported options:
;; :load-ns - if true, importing the record class will cause the
;; namespace in which the record was defined to be loaded.
;; Defaults to false.
;;
;; Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero
;; or more method bodies:
;;
;; protocol-or-interface-or-Object
;; (methodName [args*] body) *
;;
;; Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given
;; name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the
;; given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or
;; interfaces.
;;
;; The class will have the (immutable) fields named by
;; fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods
;; are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those
;; declared in the protocols/interfaces. Note that method bodies are
;; not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields,
;; and those fields can be accessed directly.
;;
;; Method definitions take the form:
;;
;; (methodname [args*] body)
;;
;; The argument and return types can be hinted on the arg and
;; methodname symbols. If not supplied, they will be inferred, so type
;; hints should be reserved for disambiguation.
;;
;; Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired
;; protocol (s) and interface (s) . You can also define overrides for
;; methods of Object. Note that a parameter must be supplied to
;; correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance) . Thus
;; methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the
;; interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method
;; head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied
;; automatically and can not be substituted.
;;
;; In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the
;; class (for calls to new, instance? etc) .
;;
;; The class will have implementations of several (clojure.lang)
;; interfaces generated automatically: IObj (metadata support) and
;; IPersistentMap, and all of their superinterfaces.
;;
;; In addition, defrecord will define type-and-value-based =,
;; and will defined Java .hashCode and .equals consistent with the
;; contract for java.util.Map.
;;
;; When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the
;; given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and
;; writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory.
;;
;; Two constructors will be defined, one taking the designated fields
;; followed by a metadata map (nil for none) and an extension field
;; map (nil for none), and one taking only the fields (using nil for
;;                                                           meta and extension fields) . Note that the field names __meta,
;; __extmap, __hash and __hasheq are currently reserved and should not
;; be used when defining your own records.
;;
;; Given (defrecord TypeName ...), two factory functions will be
;; defined: ->TypeName, taking positional parameters for the fields,
;; and map->TypeName, taking a map of keywords to field values.
